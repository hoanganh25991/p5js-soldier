Game Character
- [x] enemy focus on closest character first
- [x] character has health bar
- [x] Mario can jump on enemy to kill him -> jump mean whole body increase height, not just stand with leg move up
- [x] Songoku has kameha -> where is the kameha, we must see it fly
- [x] Tank can shoot, bullet should drawn and came out and fly -> where is the bullet, we must see it fly
- [x] Megaman can shoot mega power, power bullet came out and fly -> where is the power, we must see it fly
- [x] dont rotate character continuously, character automatically move and attach closest enemy
--------------------------------------------
- [x] remove complex effect on top of character head
- [x] remove text (too much -1,-1,-1,...) when enemy hit the character, health bar is good enough
- [x] remove aura (wave/circle under the character's feet), which cause FPS drop to 20
--------------------------------------------
- [x] character has distance when attach (mele: 100, range: 600), they have to move to next enemy to fight
- [x] hero must come much closer to enemy to fight, nearly only 10 distance
- [x] reduce character size by half, they now too big
