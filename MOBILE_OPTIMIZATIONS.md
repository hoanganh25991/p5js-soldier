# Mobile Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to make the game more playable on mobile devices.

## 1. Performance Manager

A new performance management system has been added that:
- Automatically detects device capabilities
- Adjusts quality settings based on performance
- Monitors FPS and adapts settings in real-time
- Scales particle effects, draw distance, and detail levels
- Implements different quality presets (low, medium, high, ultra)

File: `/core/managers/performanceManager.js`

## 2. GPU Acceleration

GPU acceleration has been implemented to:
- Utilize WebGL capabilities more efficiently
- Enable batch rendering for similar objects
- Support instanced rendering when available
- Reduce draw calls by grouping similar entities
- Optimize texture usage and shader performance

File: `/core/managers/gpuManager.js`

## 3. Enhanced Particle System

The particle system has been optimized to:
- Use object pooling to reduce garbage collection
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for particles based on distance
- Batch similar particles for more efficient rendering
- Limit particle counts based on device performance
- Scale particle effects based on performance settings

File: `/core/managers/particleManager.js`

## 4. Optimized Collision Detection

Collision detection has been enhanced to:
- Use spatial partitioning for efficient broad-phase collision detection
- Implement collision masks to skip unnecessary checks
- Adjust collision check frequency based on performance
- Separate broad and narrow phase collision detection
- Use optimized math for distance calculations

File: `/core/managers/collisionManager.js`

## 5. Configuration System

The configuration system has been updated to:
- Include performance-related settings
- Allow for runtime adjustment of quality settings
- Provide sensible defaults for mobile devices
- Support different quality presets
- Enable/disable expensive features based on device capabilities

File: `/config.js`

## Usage

The game will automatically detect mobile devices and adjust settings accordingly. For manual control:

1. Set `CONFIG.DEBUG_MODE = true` to display performance metrics
2. Adjust quality settings in `CONFIG.PERFORMANCE` for fine-tuning
3. The performance manager will automatically adapt to maintain target FPS

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

- Reduced particle counts and effects on mobile
- Disabled shadows and post-processing on lower-end devices
- Implemented distance-based culling to render only visible entities
- Optimized collision detection frequency on mobile
- Reduced geometric detail for distant objects

These optimizations should significantly improve the game's performance on mobile devices while maintaining visual quality where possible.
